WarderTracker
=============

Counts number of wards placed down in 10 games for League of Legends

This is a quick python script to check how many wards you've recently placed


Ported the script to Javascript(Sort of), and included a web interface.

Instructions to run the application:

1. Get Git (Git or Git for Windows)
2. Clone a copy of this repo onto your machine
3. Get Node.js and install it.  Then put the installation location of node into your system path
4. Go to the root directory of this repository.
5. Type in 'npm install' (This installs all the required packages)
5. Open up your shell (command prompt) and type in 'node server'
6. If everything works, there shouldn't be any errors
7. Browse to localhost:7000 on your web browser and you should see the application

Good Luck. Happy Warding
